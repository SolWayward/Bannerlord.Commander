# BL Commander
﻿Commander is a fully interactive in-game management system providing a GUI that uses BLGM as a framework.

Here is a little early look at it. (subject to change)

Commander will be released as a separate mod that will require BLGM.
BLGM will continue to be a standalone console based framework, while Commander will be a GUI built on top of BLGM.
Release TBD but will likely be incremental.

Commander, like BLGM will NOT use harmony, UIExtender, or ButterLib, and require no dependencies other than BLGM (and of course Bannerlord itself.
